# Build-Design-a-Robot
In this project, teams used a robotics kit to build a robot that could complete a timed trial involving slopes and item collection. The robot had to return items to a start zone. Design measurements were taken to calculate drag force and predict velocity and acceleration, helping teams test performance before the competition.
